## The Rules: How Brogram Works

Brogram‚Äôs approach is straightforward, but it packs a punch with three key rules that keep you on track:

### 1. **Rest Days Matter**

Giving your muscles time to recover is essential for building strength. Brogram encourages rest days between training sessions so your body can adapt and improve.

### 2. **Reps Done Right**

Every rep in Brogram follows a **2 - 2 - 2 tempo**, which means pausing at the start, middle, and end of each movement. This method helps you build control, strength, and endurance without risking injury.

### 3. **Picking the Right Weight**

To ensure you‚Äôre maximizing each workout, choose the heaviest weight you can handle with proper form. Here‚Äôs the weight breakdown for each set:
   - **Set 1:** 75% of working weight
   - **Set 2:** 85% of working weight
   - **Sets 3 and 4:** 100% of working weight

These guidelines help you build strength safely while challenging your muscles each time you train.

## The Training Plan: Push, Pull, Legs, Repeat üîÅ

Brogram is organized around a **Push ‚Üí Pull ‚Üí Legs** rotation:

- **Push Days** focus on upper-body pushing movements like chest presses and shoulder exercises.
- **Pull Days** target the muscles used in pulling, such as back and biceps.
- **Leg Days** hit the entire lower body, ensuring balance and full-body development.

The program encourages tracking your progress for each workout so you can see how far you‚Äôve come by the end of the 30 days!
